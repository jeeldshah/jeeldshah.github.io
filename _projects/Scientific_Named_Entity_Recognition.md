This repo consists of an End-to-end NLP scientific entity recognizer, specifically in the domain of NLP papers from these 3 NLP conferences: SemEval, EMNLP, and NAACL. We identify entities such as task names, model names, hyperparameter names and their values, and metric names and their values in these papers.
